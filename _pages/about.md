# About
I am a MSc student at the [Department of Computing and Software](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/cas/) at McMaster University, where I am working with [Dr. Matt Giamou](https://mattgiamou.ca/) at the [ARCO Lab](https://arcolab.mcmaster.ca/). I completed my BASc in the same department. 

You can find my CV [here](files/Hussein_Saad_CV.pdf).

# Research
Broadly speaking, I am interested in **geometry and optimization**. Specifically, I am focused on developing convex optimization algorithms for geometric problems, with a particular interest in **Riemannian manifolds**. Recently, my research has centered on challenges in **robotics**. I am attracted to theoretical research that provides comprehensive solutions to a family of problems, rather than ad-hoc approaches.

# Blog
I (try to) blog about interesting mathematics that doesn't necessarily align with my research direction. You can find my posts here.
